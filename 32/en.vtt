WEBVTT

01:19.412 --> 01:20.042
Quick.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.078
We can't hold them back much longer.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.090
Hurry.

01:29.923 --> 01:30.973
- Come on!
- Get up!

01:39.307 --> 01:39.927
Quick!

01:45.689 --> 01:46.309
Faster!

01:59.411 --> 02:01.331
Open the doors. Come on, quickly!

02:29.232 --> 02:31.192
Just read them the sentence.

02:35.238 --> 02:39.118
The sentence of the court
is that in two days hence

02:39.284 --> 02:43.464
the perfumer journeyman
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille

02:44.539 --> 02:46.879
shall be bound to a wooden cross

02:47.334 --> 02:49.504
with his face raised toward heaven.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.008
And whilst still alive

02:54.549 --> 02:57.799
be dealt twelve blows
with an iron rod

03:00.430 --> 03:03.430
breaking the joints of his arms,

03:04.517 --> 03:06.057
his shoulders,

03:07.062 --> 03:08.102
his hips,

03:08.730 --> 03:09.730
his legs.

03:12.067 --> 03:16.197
He shall then be raised up
to hang until dead

03:16.905 --> 03:19.565
and all customary acts of mercy

03:19.991 --> 03:22.411
are expressly forbidden
the executioner.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.298
In 18th-century France,

03:34.589 --> 03:36.419
there lived a man who was
one of the most gifted

03:36.591 --> 03:39.591
and notorious personages
of his time.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.560
His name was
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille,

03:44.766 --> 03:47.186
and if his name has been
forgotten today, it is

03:47.602 --> 03:51.772
for the reason that his ambition
was restricted to a domain

03:51.940 --> 03:54.440
that leaves no trace in history:

03:59.531 --> 04:02.331
To the fleeting realm of scent.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.375
In the period of which we speak,

04:18.550 --> 04:21.090
there reigned
in the cities a stench

04:21.261 --> 04:24.011
barely conceivable to us
modern men and women.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.232
Naturally, the stench
was foulest in Paris,

04:28.393 --> 04:30.983
for Paris was
the largest city in Europe.

04:31.896 --> 04:35.566
And nowhere in Paris was that
stench more profoundly repugnant

04:35.734 --> 04:37.784
than in the city's fish market.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.158
Here we are.
I'll get another box.

04:43.658 --> 04:47.698
It was here, then, on the most
putrid spot in the whole kingdom,

04:47.954 --> 04:49.794
that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille

04:49.956 --> 04:52.706
was born
on the 17th of July, 1738.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.987
It was his mother's fifth birth.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.743
She'd delivered them all here
under her fishstand,

05:22.906 --> 05:25.946
and all had been stillbirths,
or semi-stillbirths,

05:26.117 --> 05:27.157
You all right?

05:28.036 --> 05:32.206
And the whole mess was shoveled
with the fishguts into the river.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.044
It would be
much the same today

05:36.419 --> 05:37.549
but then,

05:38.171 --> 05:40.921
Jean-Baptiste chose differently.

06:14.874 --> 06:15.924
What's that noise?

06:17.836 --> 06:19.166
- It's a baby.
- What's going on here?

06:23.842 --> 06:25.222
It's a newborn.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.052
Where's its mother?

06:28.763 --> 06:29.853
She was just here.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.935
She tried to kill it.
Her own child.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.649
She tried to kill her baby!

06:39.357 --> 06:40.817
There! There she is!

06:41.276 --> 06:42.686
Stop! Stop where you are!

06:42.861 --> 06:43.821
Murderer!

06:44.362 --> 06:47.912
Thus, the first sound
to escape Grenouille's lips

06:48.158 --> 06:50.328
sent his mother to the gallows

06:53.997 --> 06:56.577
and Jean-Baptiste,
by official order,

06:57.667 --> 06:59.707
to the orphanage
of Madame Gaillard.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.262
How many today?

07:05.633 --> 07:07.593
Four. Well, three and a half.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.021
As usual, more dead than alive.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.942
Just take the money and sign.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.819
Make room.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.236
- Where?
- Move!

07:32.410 --> 07:34.000
Go on, now.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.085
Is it dead?

08:13.702 --> 08:15.702
That's not staying in my bed.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.867
- Let's throw it out, then.
- What if it screams?

08:20.125 --> 08:21.245
Let's just kill it.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.145
Harder! Push!

08:43.940 --> 08:45.440
What are you doing?

08:54.868 --> 08:58.958
For Mme Gaillard, Grenouille was a
source of income, like any other.

08:59.789 --> 09:00.999
The children, however,
sensed at once

09:01.750 --> 09:05.250
that there was something
different about him.

09:22.187 --> 09:26.357
By the age of five, Jean-Baptiste
still could not talk.

09:27.859 --> 09:32.029
But he was born with a talent that
made him unique among mankind.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.803
It was not that the other
children hated him,

10:39.472 --> 10:41.892
they felt unnerved by him.

10:46.229 --> 10:50.279
Increasingly he became aware that
his phenomenal sense of smell

10:50.442 --> 10:54.032
was a gift that had been
given to him, and him alone.

11:03.246 --> 11:06.326
When Jean-Baptiste
did finally learn to speak

11:06.499 --> 11:09.839
he soon found that everyday
language proved inadequate

11:10.003 --> 11:14.013
for all the olfactory experiences
accumulating within himself.

11:18.887 --> 11:19.757
Wood.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.267
Warm wood.

11:28.938 --> 11:29.728
Grass.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.896
Wet grass.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.491
Stones.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.645
Warm stones.

11:39.783 --> 11:40.413
Water.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.161
Cold water.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.249
Frog.

11:54.839 --> 11:55.969
Wet stones.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.433
Big, wet frog stones.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.215
Something.

12:05.892 --> 12:06.772
Something.

12:07.769 --> 12:08.649
Something.

12:10.772 --> 12:14.942
By 13, Mme Gaillard no longer
had room for Jean-Baptiste

12:15.110 --> 12:17.490
and therefore
decided to sell him.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.284
Come on.

12:22.117 --> 12:22.987
Ten francs.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.415
From his first breath of the odor
enveloping this man...

12:28.581 --> 12:30.791
Seven, and not one sou more.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.841
...Grenouille knew that
his life in Grimal's tannery

12:34.004 --> 12:37.134
would be worth precisely as much
as the work he could accomplish.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.297
Unfortunately for Madame Gaillard,

12:47.142 --> 12:49.312
the bargain was short-lived.

12:55.650 --> 12:59.360
Life expectancy in the tannery
was a mere five years

13:00.238 --> 13:03.908
but Jean-Baptiste proved to be
as tough as a resilient bacterium.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.293
He adjusted to his new fate

13:06.453 --> 13:09.713
and became a paragon
of docility and diligence.

13:09.873 --> 13:13.843
Slaved 15, 16 hours a day,
summer and winter.

13:15.587 --> 13:19.467
Gradually he became aware
of a world beyond the tannery,

13:20.842 --> 13:25.012
where a Utopia of unexplored
smells lay in store for him.

13:49.996 --> 13:50.616
Grenouille!

13:55.085 --> 13:58.205
Come with us. I'm taking you
to town for delivery.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.009
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille
had triumphed.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.512
He was alive

14:04.594 --> 14:07.684
and at last he was
in his element.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.262
He was not choosy.

14:49.889 --> 14:54.059
He did not differentiate between
what are good smells from bad,

14:56.104 --> 14:57.524
at least not yet.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.652
He was very greedy.

15:03.862 --> 15:08.032
The goal was to possess everything
the world had to offer in odors.

15:10.035 --> 15:14.035
His only condition being,
that they were new ones.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.500
Thousands upon thousands of odors
formed an invisible gruel

15:20.670 --> 15:24.800
which he dissected into its
most remote parts and pieces.

15:42.275 --> 15:42.935
Grenouille!

15:47.322 --> 15:47.952
Come on!

15:52.786 --> 15:53.446
Get your ass over here!

15:56.873 --> 15:59.963
He needs two dozen skins
by next week. Can you do that?

16:00.877 --> 16:03.457
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, come with me.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.362
What is it called?

17:10.697 --> 17:13.777
"Amor and Psyche", madame.
My latest creation.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.244
May I try it?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.753
If you'll allow me, mademoiselle.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.513
Sheer heaven!

17:32.052 --> 17:35.392
Monsieur Pelissier,
you are truly an artiste.

19:12.318 --> 19:15.068
Please, take them.
I've got far too many.

20:04.621 --> 20:05.621
What do you want?

20:15.131 --> 20:16.011
Want to buy some?

20:30.021 --> 20:31.311
Two for a sou.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.896
Next time you run off like that,
I'll kill you!

26:52.112 --> 26:54.702
That night, he could not sleep.

26:56.491 --> 27:00.661
The intoxicating power of the
girl's scent made it clear to him

27:00.829 --> 27:04.999
why he'd come to his own life
so tenaciously, so savagely.

27:06.626 --> 27:10.796
The purpose of his miserable
existence had a higher destiny.

27:12.674 --> 27:15.144
He would learn
how to preserve scent

27:15.760 --> 27:19.560
so that never again would he
lose such sublime beauty.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.790
There were about a dozen
perfumers in Paris in those days.

27:49.044 --> 27:53.214
One of them, the once-celebrated
Italian perfumer, Giuseppe Baldini,

27:53.381 --> 27:56.931
had set up shop in the center of
the bridge called Pont au Change

27:57.093 --> 28:00.183
on his arrival in Paris
over thirty years ago.

28:00.972 --> 28:05.022
To be sure, at one time in
his youth, Baldini had created

28:05.393 --> 28:09.313
several truly great perfumes,
to which he owed his fortune.

28:11.024 --> 28:13.494
But now Baldini was

28:13.651 --> 28:15.781
out of touch, out of fashion,

28:15.945 --> 28:19.695
and spent his days waiting for
customers that no longer came.

28:21.618 --> 28:23.618
- Chénier! There you are!
- Monsieur Baldini.

28:23.828 --> 28:24.868
Put on your wig.

28:26.081 --> 28:27.251
Put on your wig!

28:29.793 --> 28:30.633
You going out?

28:31.211 --> 28:33.461
I wish to retire to my study
for a few hours

28:33.630 --> 28:36.130
and do not want to be disturbed
under any circumstances.

28:36.341 --> 28:37.931
Will you be creating a new
perfume, Monsieur Baldini?

28:39.052 --> 28:41.102
Correct. For Count Verhamont.

28:41.805 --> 28:45.475
He has asked for something like...
I think he said it was called...

28:46.309 --> 28:50.479
Amor and Psyche from that swindler
in the Rue Saint André des Arts.

28:51.064 --> 28:51.694
Pelissier?

28:52.107 --> 28:54.187
Pelissier, that's him.

28:56.069 --> 28:57.569
Amor and Psyche!

29:02.492 --> 29:03.242
Do you know it?

29:03.410 --> 29:06.330
Oh, yes. You can smell it
everywhere these days, monsieur.

29:07.664 --> 29:08.924
On every street corner.

29:10.417 --> 29:13.547
In fact, I just
purchased you a sample.

29:15.588 --> 29:17.008
In case you wanted to test it.

29:20.385 --> 29:23.215
What on earth makes you think I'd
be interested in testing it?

29:25.306 --> 29:27.846
You're right.
It's nothing special.

29:28.393 --> 29:31.233
Actually
it's a very common scent.

29:31.771 --> 29:34.611
I believe the head chord
contains lime oil.

29:36.735 --> 29:40.025
Really? And the heart chord?

29:40.905 --> 29:42.815
Orange blossom, I believe.

29:43.742 --> 29:46.412
And civet in the base chord,

29:46.578 --> 29:48.118
but, you know,
I cannot say for sure.

29:48.288 --> 29:51.168
Well, I couldn't care less
what that bungler Pelissier

29:51.332 --> 29:53.632
- slops into his perfumes.
- Naturally not, monsieur.

29:54.461 --> 29:57.511
And I am thinking of creating
something for Count Verhamont

29:58.381 --> 30:00.841
that will cause
a veritable sensation.

30:02.135 --> 30:03.885
I'm sure it will,
Monsieur Baldini.

30:05.096 --> 30:08.676
Take charge of the shop, Chénier,
and don't let anyone come near me.

30:09.142 --> 30:11.982
Inspiration requires
peace and tranquility.

30:54.813 --> 30:56.023
Is there anything else you need?

30:57.315 --> 30:58.935
Inspiration, perhaps.

30:59.401 --> 31:00.781
Ah, my Giuseppe.

31:03.405 --> 31:05.905
You are still
the great perfumer Baldini.

32:01.796 --> 32:02.706
Wonderful.

32:07.052 --> 32:08.602
He did it again.

32:16.394 --> 32:17.734
Lime oil.

32:21.358 --> 32:22.688
Orange blossom,

32:23.651 --> 32:24.281
to be sure.

32:29.032 --> 32:30.872
And a hint of cloves, perhaps.

32:33.119 --> 32:33.869
No.

32:36.039 --> 32:37.079
Or could be cinnamon?

32:39.834 --> 32:40.464
It's gone.

32:44.714 --> 32:45.344
Cinnamon.

32:46.883 --> 32:47.763
It's not cinnamon.

32:52.180 --> 32:52.810
Cloves.

32:53.431 --> 32:54.061
No.

32:55.266 --> 32:56.136
Musk?

32:56.351 --> 32:56.981
No.

33:38.143 --> 33:39.193
Who's there?

33:39.561 --> 33:41.311
I'm from Grimal's tannery.

33:44.858 --> 33:46.478
I've got the goatskins
you ordered.

33:52.991 --> 33:53.741
Follow me.

34:00.331 --> 34:00.961
This way.

34:35.867 --> 34:36.527
There.

34:37.410 --> 34:38.200
Lay them there.

34:48.046 --> 34:50.376
Tell your master
that the skins are fine.

34:50.548 --> 34:52.758
I'll come by in the next
few days and pay for them.

34:54.094 --> 34:54.894
Yes, Monsieur.

35:01.643 --> 35:03.943
You want to make this leather
smell good, don't you?

35:05.855 --> 35:07.605
Why, of course and so it shall.

35:08.566 --> 35:10.356
With Amor & Psyche
by Pelissier?

35:15.532 --> 35:19.162
Whatever gave you the absurd idea
I would use someone else's perfume?

35:20.245 --> 35:21.535
It's all over you.

35:22.122 --> 35:24.252
It's on your forehead,
your nose, your hands...

35:24.416 --> 35:26.496
It's bad, Amor & Psyche
is, Master.

35:26.668 --> 35:28.208
There's too much rosemary in it.

35:28.378 --> 35:29.548
And too much of...

35:31.256 --> 35:33.046
that and that.

35:36.386 --> 35:39.466
Bergamot and Patchouli?

35:39.723 --> 35:40.353
Pat...?

35:41.766 --> 35:42.426
Patchouli.

35:42.767 --> 35:43.637
Patchouli.

35:49.399 --> 35:50.029
What else?

35:54.154 --> 35:54.824
That and that.

35:57.449 --> 35:58.199
That and that.

36:08.418 --> 36:09.628
Orange blossom,

36:11.463 --> 36:12.093
lime...

36:13.673 --> 36:14.923
- Rosemary.
- Musk.

36:18.887 --> 36:20.057
And cloves?

36:20.513 --> 36:21.223
And this.

36:30.690 --> 36:33.030
- Storax?
- That's in it too.

36:33.276 --> 36:36.236
- Storax.
- Storax.

36:43.411 --> 36:46.121
You have, it appears,
a fine nose, young man.

36:46.289 --> 36:48.579
My nose knows all the smells
in the world.

36:48.750 --> 36:51.590
It's the best nose in Paris,
only I don't know the names.

36:51.753 --> 36:53.213
I need to learn the names,
learn them all...

36:53.380 --> 36:54.510
No, no, no!

36:54.714 --> 36:56.424
You don't interrupt me
when I'm speaking.

36:56.591 --> 36:58.551
You are both impertinent
and insolent.

36:59.761 --> 37:01.891
Even I don't know every scent.

37:04.557 --> 37:07.727
I've, of course, known for some time
the ingredients of Amor & Psyche.

37:07.894 --> 37:11.944
But all it needs to find that out is
a passably fine nose, nothing else.

37:13.983 --> 37:16.993
But it needs the craft
of a true perfumer

37:18.029 --> 37:19.819
to detect the exact formula,

37:20.573 --> 37:22.413
which notes, which chords,

37:22.617 --> 37:24.907
and in what precise measurements.

37:26.663 --> 37:29.713
Could you tell me the exact
formula of Amor & Psyche?

37:32.585 --> 37:33.795
Best-nose-in-Paris!

37:39.551 --> 37:40.261
Speak up!

37:42.053 --> 37:43.223
You see, you can't. Can you?

37:43.805 --> 37:45.015
And I'll tell you why.

37:46.641 --> 37:48.941
Because talent means
next to nothing,

37:51.479 --> 37:53.979
while experience acquired

37:54.482 --> 37:57.612
in humility and hard work
means everything.

38:02.449 --> 38:04.579
I don't know what a formula is,

38:05.326 --> 38:07.576
but I can make Amor & Psyche
for you now.

38:09.497 --> 38:12.537
And you think I just let you
slop around in my laboratory

38:12.709 --> 38:14.839
with essential oils
that are worth a fortune?

38:15.170 --> 38:15.800
You?

38:16.963 --> 38:17.593
Yes.

38:18.089 --> 38:19.299
Now pay attention!

38:22.927 --> 38:24.467
What is your name, anyway?

38:26.973 --> 38:28.183
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

38:31.102 --> 38:33.062
Very well,
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille,

38:35.565 --> 38:38.605
you shall have the opportunity now
to prove your assertion.

38:38.943 --> 38:41.783
Your grandiose failure will also
be an opportunity for you

38:42.155 --> 38:43.815
to learn the virtue of humility.

38:43.990 --> 38:46.950
- How much do you want me to make?
- How much of what...?

38:47.327 --> 38:48.907
How much Amor & Psyche do you want?

38:51.831 --> 38:53.211
Shall I fill this flask?

38:53.625 --> 38:55.375
No! You shall not!

39:05.220 --> 39:06.260
You may fill this one.

39:06.596 --> 39:07.556
Yes, Master.

39:11.184 --> 39:12.604
But, Master Baldini...

39:13.812 --> 39:16.152
You must let me do it in my own way.

39:16.815 --> 39:17.815
As you please.

39:23.905 --> 39:24.525
No!

39:25.281 --> 39:29.371
Don't drop it. That's pure alcohol.
You want to blow up the building?

39:32.414 --> 39:33.964
You have to measure it first!

40:22.714 --> 40:24.554
Stop, stop it!

40:24.799 --> 40:26.259
That's enough!

40:26.760 --> 40:27.890
You know nothing!

40:28.595 --> 40:31.135
Essential oils are always
to be mixed first,

40:31.723 --> 40:33.183
then the alcohol added

40:33.391 --> 40:36.391
and never ever is perfume
to be shaken like that!

40:36.895 --> 40:39.805
I must have been insane to listen
to your asinine gibberish!

40:42.484 --> 40:43.324
It's all done.

41:29.906 --> 41:31.196
This is Amor & Psyche!

41:32.951 --> 41:34.911
But it's not
a good perfume, Master.

41:36.788 --> 41:39.998
If you let me again, Master,
I'll make it more better.

42:55.408 --> 42:57.408
Now it's a really good perfume.

43:04.626 --> 43:06.626
Don't you want
to smell it, Master?

43:06.795 --> 43:08.795
I'm not in the mood
to test it now.

43:08.963 --> 43:11.343
I have other things
on my mind. Go now.

43:13.677 --> 43:15.467
- But, Master...
- Go! Now!

43:31.194 --> 43:33.324
Can I come to work
for you, master? Can I?

43:36.241 --> 43:37.531
Let me think about it.

43:37.701 --> 43:38.331
Master!

43:40.328 --> 43:43.458
I have to learn
how to keep smell!

43:44.833 --> 43:45.543
What?

43:47.127 --> 43:48.457
Can you teach me that?

43:49.879 --> 43:51.669
I shall have to think
about it. Now, go.

44:38.636 --> 44:39.506
I love you.

44:46.644 --> 44:48.774
I'll give you 50 francs for him.

44:56.529 --> 44:57.359
Grenouille!

44:58.406 --> 45:00.696
Grimal's transaction

45:00.867 --> 45:03.287
had a profound effect
on all three parties.

45:06.956 --> 45:09.626
Not least upon
Monsieur Grimal himself.

45:12.837 --> 45:16.297
As for Giuseppe Baldini,
the acquisition of Grenouille

45:16.466 --> 45:19.756
miraculously transformed
his dwindling business

45:19.928 --> 45:22.598
even surpassing its former glory.

45:30.939 --> 45:32.729
While at last, for Jean-Baptiste,

45:32.899 --> 45:35.489
the mysterious secrets
of the perfumer's craft

45:36.069 --> 45:37.699
began to unfold.

45:43.993 --> 45:46.663
Now, pay careful attention
to what I tell you.

45:46.830 --> 45:50.000
Just like a musical chord,
a perfume chord contains

45:50.166 --> 45:51.326
four essences

45:51.501 --> 45:55.341
or notes, carefully selected
for their harmonic affinity.

45:55.630 --> 45:58.470
Each perfume contains three chords:

45:58.633 --> 46:00.643
The head, the heart and the base,

46:01.219 --> 46:03.509
necessitating twelve notes in all.

46:04.431 --> 46:06.431
The head chord contains

46:06.599 --> 46:09.139
the first impression,
lasting a few minutes

46:09.310 --> 46:11.350
before giving way
to the heart chord,

46:11.521 --> 46:14.941
the theme of the perfume,
lasting several hours.

46:15.108 --> 46:17.438
Finally, the base chord,

46:18.236 --> 46:21.526
the trail of the perfume,
lasting several days.

46:26.327 --> 46:29.287
Mind you, the ancient Egyptians
believed that one can only create

46:29.456 --> 46:33.376
a truly original perfume
by adding an extra note,

46:33.918 --> 46:37.508
one final essence
that will ring out

46:38.423 --> 46:40.303
and dominate the others.

46:43.011 --> 46:47.181
Legend has it that an amphora
was once found in a pharaoh's tomb

46:47.807 --> 46:51.437
and when it was opened
a perfume was released.

46:51.603 --> 46:54.563
After all those thousands of years,

46:54.731 --> 46:58.741
a perfume of such subtle
beauty and yet such power,

46:58.902 --> 47:01.452
that for one single moment

47:01.613 --> 47:05.783
every person on earth believed
they were in paradise.

47:08.078 --> 47:10.538
Twelve essences could be identified,

47:11.748 --> 47:13.038
but the 13th,

47:14.250 --> 47:15.380
the vital one,

47:17.420 --> 47:19.300
could never be determined.

47:21.257 --> 47:22.047
Why not?

47:24.594 --> 47:26.724
Why not?
What do you mean, why not?

47:28.264 --> 47:30.854
Because it's a legend, numbskull!

47:32.102 --> 47:33.402
What's a legend?

47:35.980 --> 47:36.820
Never mind.

48:19.232 --> 48:20.112
Jean-Baptiste.

48:20.692 --> 48:21.572
Jean-Baptiste?

48:27.824 --> 48:28.954
What's the matter?

48:29.534 --> 48:30.204
Master,

48:31.119 --> 48:33.409
I have to learn
how to capture scent.

48:36.374 --> 48:37.584
What are you talking about?

48:38.126 --> 48:40.836
I have to learn
how to capture scent

48:41.004 --> 48:42.424
and reprise it forever.

48:43.089 --> 48:44.299
You mean, preserve.

48:44.632 --> 48:46.012
You have to teach me that.

48:46.760 --> 48:48.180
All right.
Calm down, my boy.

48:49.012 --> 48:49.682
Calm down.

48:50.722 --> 48:51.932
We have work to do.

48:54.184 --> 48:56.524
"The soul of beings is their scent."

48:57.896 --> 48:59.266
You said that, master.

49:00.940 --> 49:01.650
Did I?

49:02.525 --> 49:04.605
I will make you
as many perfumes as you want

49:04.819 --> 49:06.399
but you have to teach me

49:06.780 --> 49:08.910
how to capture
the smell of all things.

49:10.700 --> 49:11.620
Can you do that?

49:13.411 --> 49:15.461
Well, naturally.

49:15.789 --> 49:17.709
Then teach me
everything you know

49:21.336 --> 49:23.706
and I'll make you the best
perfume in the whole world.

49:41.981 --> 49:43.901
Imagine, Jean-Baptiste,

49:44.067 --> 49:47.107
ten thousand roses to produce

49:47.278 --> 49:50.318
one single ounce of essential oil.

49:53.827 --> 49:57.577
Now, keep the air flowing or the
bottom petals will begin to stew

49:58.790 --> 50:02.340
while I set up the alembic.
And take care not to damage them.

50:02.627 --> 50:05.757
We have to let them go to their
deaths with their scent intact.

50:24.983 --> 50:25.733
Perfect.

50:26.860 --> 50:28.450
Now, help me
with the Moor's head.

50:41.791 --> 50:43.341
Temperature is vital.

50:43.501 --> 50:47.211
When the quicksilver is here,
the heat is precisely correct

50:47.380 --> 50:50.010
and the oil will gradually rise.

50:52.635 --> 50:56.765
Note this mechanism is a remarkable
invention of my own devising.

50:57.599 --> 51:00.439
You will observe how cold water

51:01.061 --> 51:03.691
is pumped through here

51:06.066 --> 51:09.356
allowing the essence
to condense here

51:09.527 --> 51:13.617
until it finally appears

51:15.658 --> 51:16.448
here.

51:17.827 --> 51:21.037
Of course,
out on the hillside above Grasse

51:21.206 --> 51:23.916
we had only to bellow
pure, fresh air.

51:25.377 --> 51:28.457
Ah, Grasse. What a town.

51:30.423 --> 51:32.133
The Rome of scents.

51:33.468 --> 51:35.888
The Promised Land of perfume.

51:37.597 --> 51:41.767
No man can rightly
call himself a perfumer

51:42.310 --> 51:46.480
unless he has proved his worth
in that hallowed place.

51:49.234 --> 51:51.744
Not to worry.
Happens all the time.

51:53.738 --> 51:54.488
To Grasse.

52:13.174 --> 52:13.804
Master.

52:15.510 --> 52:16.140
Look.

52:22.100 --> 52:24.060
The very soul of the rose.

53:18.656 --> 53:19.406
Jean-Baptiste.

53:23.244 --> 53:24.004
What's wrong?

53:26.039 --> 53:27.039
Jean-Baptiste.

53:30.460 --> 53:31.540
What have you done?

53:32.295 --> 53:34.255
- You lied.
- What?

53:35.298 --> 53:36.218
You lied to me.

53:37.592 --> 53:40.352
How dare you talk to me like that.

53:41.763 --> 53:44.523
You said I could capture
the scent of anything.

53:45.392 --> 53:46.562
And so you can.

53:51.022 --> 53:52.152
What do you smell?

53:53.441 --> 53:54.571
What do you smell?

54:00.115 --> 54:00.815
Nothing.

54:04.411 --> 54:06.291
What were you expecting to smell?

54:06.621 --> 54:07.461
Glass.

54:08.707 --> 54:10.287
But glass doesn't smell.

54:10.709 --> 54:12.499
Course it does.
What's this?

54:18.008 --> 54:19.378
I don't smell a thing.

54:20.593 --> 54:22.473
It should smell like copper!

54:22.721 --> 54:23.471
Enough!

54:26.766 --> 54:30.146
You were trying to distill
the smell of copper?

54:30.770 --> 54:33.770
Iron? Glass? Copper?

54:38.194 --> 54:39.654
What else did you try?

54:43.616 --> 54:44.576
No!

54:45.952 --> 54:49.002
Have you gone completely insane?

54:49.914 --> 54:51.884
You told me I had to experiment.

54:52.709 --> 54:54.839
Experiment? Experiment?

54:55.545 --> 54:57.455
But not with the cat.

55:00.842 --> 55:02.552
What kind of a human being are you?

55:03.470 --> 55:04.930
Don't you know anything?

55:05.513 --> 55:07.603
You can no more distill
the scent of a cat

55:07.766 --> 55:09.726
than you can distill
the scent of you or me.

55:20.987 --> 55:21.777
I can't?

55:22.197 --> 55:23.317
Of course not!

55:31.247 --> 55:32.787
He is in stadio ultimo.

55:32.957 --> 55:34.287
- What?
- He's dying.

55:34.626 --> 55:36.166
Is there nothing you can do?

55:36.628 --> 55:39.838
- I fear not.
- No! He cannot die.

55:40.340 --> 55:42.300
Well, my fee is 50 francs.

55:42.467 --> 55:43.587
50 francs?

55:43.760 --> 55:46.720
You charlatan!
You can't even name the disease!

55:50.767 --> 55:52.637
No! Jean-Baptiste!

55:55.188 --> 55:56.608
You cannot do this to me.

55:57.649 --> 56:01.819
Not now. Not yet.

56:13.665 --> 56:14.495
Is there

56:19.754 --> 56:20.964
any other way

56:23.216 --> 56:26.006
to preserve smell
besides distill it?

56:26.469 --> 56:27.679
Jean-Baptiste?

56:33.226 --> 56:34.386
Is there, master?

56:35.979 --> 56:38.979
Well, yes, I believe there is.

56:40.692 --> 56:41.692
What is it?

56:44.529 --> 56:48.199
It is known as the mysterious
art of enfleurage.

56:51.161 --> 56:52.121
Can you teach me?

56:56.041 --> 56:58.841
Not even I am intimate
with its secrets.

57:02.172 --> 57:04.262
But could I learn it in Grasse?

57:05.508 --> 57:08.178
- Well...
- Could I?

57:14.601 --> 57:16.391
Where else but in Grasse?

57:24.069 --> 57:26.489
Within a week Grenouille
was well again,

57:26.654 --> 57:30.834
but to travel to Grasse to find
a job he needed journey papers.

57:32.410 --> 57:34.160
Baldini agreed to provide them

57:34.537 --> 57:36.407
on condition that
Grenouille left him

57:36.581 --> 57:40.041
not less than one hundred
formulas for new perfumes.

57:41.252 --> 57:45.012
Grenouille did not mind. He
could have given him a thousand.

57:51.304 --> 57:55.274
The morning of Grenouille's
departure, Baldini was pleased.

57:55.558 --> 57:59.438
At last, he felt rewarded for
his many years of hard work.

58:00.230 --> 58:03.070
He could not remember
a happier day.

58:03.858 --> 58:06.898
Deeply satisfied,
he went back to sleep

58:07.070 --> 58:09.820
and awoke no more in this life.

58:29.509 --> 58:33.679
With every step he took from
the city, the happier he felt.

58:34.764 --> 58:38.944
The air above him grew
clearer, purer, cleaner,

58:39.686 --> 58:42.726
and at last he was able
to breathe freely.

58:46.484 --> 58:48.864
There were two ways
to reach Grasse.

58:49.779 --> 58:52.989
The first followed the winding
roads through the villages

58:53.158 --> 58:57.288
while the second lead across
the mountains, down into Provence.

58:59.622 --> 59:01.462
The choice was quite easy.

59:05.837 --> 59:08.087
Thus his nose led him
ever higher,

59:08.298 --> 59:10.588
ever further from mankind,

59:11.509 --> 59:15.679
more towards the magnetic pole of
the greatest possible solitude.

59:55.470 --> 59:59.220
Grenouille needed a moment to
believe that he had actually found

59:59.391 --> 1:00:02.981
a spot on earth where scent
was almost absent.

1:00:08.358 --> 1:00:12.528
Spread all around lay nothing but
the tranquil scent of dead stone.

1:00:16.241 --> 1:00:18.701
There was something sacred
about this place.

1:00:23.081 --> 1:00:25.881
No longer distracted
by anything external,

1:00:26.418 --> 1:00:30.258
he was finally able to bask
in his own existence

1:00:32.799 --> 1:00:34.589
and found it splendid.

1:00:43.435 --> 1:00:47.185
After a while, he almost forgot
his plans and obsessions

1:00:49.274 --> 1:00:52.404
and, indeed, might have done
so altogether.

1:01:07.625 --> 1:01:08.375
Hello?

1:01:13.048 --> 1:01:13.798
Hello?

1:01:17.135 --> 1:01:17.885
Hello?

1:01:36.404 --> 1:01:39.204
There were a thousand
smells in his clothes.

1:01:39.366 --> 1:01:42.156
The smell of sand,
stone, moss.

1:01:42.327 --> 1:01:45.537
Even the smell of the sausage
he'd eaten weeks ago.

1:01:45.705 --> 1:01:47.865
Only one smell was not there.

1:01:51.127 --> 1:01:52.247
His own.

1:02:29.708 --> 1:02:33.878
For the first time, Grenouille
realized he had no smell.

1:02:36.464 --> 1:02:40.474
He realized that all his life
he had been a nobody to everyone.

1:02:41.511 --> 1:02:45.101
What he now felt was the fear
of his own oblivion.

1:02:46.307 --> 1:02:49.637
It was as though
he did not exist.

1:02:55.483 --> 1:02:59.613
By the first light of next morning,
Grenouille had a new plan.

1:03:00.238 --> 1:03:02.408
He must continue
his journey to Grasse.

1:03:03.491 --> 1:03:06.911
There he would teach the world
not only that he existed,

1:03:07.078 --> 1:03:08.828
that he was someone,

1:03:09.205 --> 1:03:11.205
but that he was exceptional.

1:03:15.628 --> 1:03:17.008
And with this decision

1:03:17.964 --> 1:03:21.634
it seemed that the gods had
at last begun to smile on him.

1:04:44.134 --> 1:04:45.184
Go in.

1:07:49.652 --> 1:07:50.282
Laura?

1:07:58.870 --> 1:07:59.500
Laura?

1:08:00.830 --> 1:08:01.710
Coming, Papa.

1:08:39.411 --> 1:08:41.331
Haven't seen you here before.

1:08:43.289 --> 1:08:44.749
It's my first season.

1:08:46.376 --> 1:08:48.166
Picking together
is always more fun.

1:08:50.088 --> 1:08:51.798
They say you pick
everything you find.

1:09:36.634 --> 1:09:37.264
Idiot!

1:09:37.927 --> 1:09:40.217
How many times have I told you
not to cram the blossoms in

1:09:40.430 --> 1:09:43.810
like you're stuffing a chicken?

1:09:44.059 --> 1:09:45.809
Watch how Grenouille does it.

1:09:47.979 --> 1:09:50.149
Look how skillfully
he handles them.

1:09:50.648 --> 1:09:54.358
The whole art of enfleurage is
to allow the flowers to die slowly.

1:09:54.527 --> 1:09:56.647
In their sleep, as it were.

1:09:56.821 --> 1:10:00.951
Handle them as you would a lady.
Wouldn't you agree with me, Druot?

1:10:01.868 --> 1:10:03.038
If you say so, Madame.

1:10:06.331 --> 1:10:08.581
You. Check the jonquil blossoms.

1:10:12.629 --> 1:10:13.709
They need more time.

1:10:16.841 --> 1:10:18.091
Do what I say!

1:11:02.762 --> 1:11:03.642
Stop it!

1:11:05.056 --> 1:11:05.886
I'm not in the mood.

1:11:06.599 --> 1:11:07.479
Are you sure?

1:11:08.935 --> 1:11:10.305
Of course I'm sure.

1:11:17.235 --> 1:11:18.445
I said...

1:11:21.448 --> 1:11:22.408
...no!

1:11:34.127 --> 1:11:35.207
Suit yourself.

1:11:39.049 --> 1:11:39.719
Lucien?

1:11:43.970 --> 1:11:45.260
Fetch me back the ladder.

1:11:45.513 --> 1:11:46.603
Fetch it yourself.

1:11:58.902 --> 1:11:59.532
Lucien?

1:12:03.490 --> 1:12:04.320
Lucien!

1:12:15.835 --> 1:12:16.455
Lucien?

1:12:20.256 --> 1:12:20.876
Lucien?

1:12:40.443 --> 1:12:41.073
Lucien?

1:13:39.377 --> 1:13:43.257
Tuberoses for Madame Arnulfi.
She here?

1:13:47.218 --> 1:13:47.928
She's busy.

1:13:56.019 --> 1:13:57.809
Seems such a waste to boil them.

1:13:59.689 --> 1:14:01.229
Or whatever you do with them.

1:14:06.905 --> 1:14:08.405
So what do you do with them?

1:14:09.991 --> 1:14:11.871
Warm them in animal fat.

1:14:12.327 --> 1:14:15.907
- What for?
- The fat soaks up their scent.

1:14:16.706 --> 1:14:17.576
Then what?

1:14:20.293 --> 1:14:22.503
Then I cool it to a pomade

1:14:24.673 --> 1:14:27.973
and then I filter it before...

1:14:32.681 --> 1:14:33.601
Before what?

1:14:34.933 --> 1:14:37.853
Before I add in alcohol and
other essences to make a perfume.

1:14:38.019 --> 1:14:38.939
Don't touch anything.

1:14:45.193 --> 1:14:46.073
What's in there?

1:14:47.612 --> 1:14:48.452
Nothing. Just flowers.

1:14:49.948 --> 1:14:51.198
- Can I look?
- No.

1:14:51.783 --> 1:14:53.033
Not now. I've got work to do.

1:14:53.326 --> 1:14:54.236
You must go now.

1:14:54.411 --> 1:14:56.751
- Come on. Let me look.
- Don't touch.

1:14:56.913 --> 1:14:58.083
Ah, my tuberoses.

1:14:59.958 --> 1:15:01.248
Morning, Madame.

1:15:01.793 --> 1:15:02.503
Morning.

1:15:06.214 --> 1:15:08.054
Why have you covered the tank?

1:15:09.592 --> 1:15:11.012
It's an experiment, Madame.

1:15:14.305 --> 1:15:16.515
To protect the blossoms
from daylight.

1:15:17.142 --> 1:15:18.812
To preserve the scent better.

1:15:20.145 --> 1:15:21.895
Well, if you say so.

1:15:23.815 --> 1:15:26.985
Come with me. I'll settle
your master's account.

1:15:29.696 --> 1:15:32.116
To preserve
their scent better, you say?

1:15:46.421 --> 1:15:47.711
I don't smell much.

1:15:54.346 --> 1:15:57.846
No. Then my experiment
was a failure.

1:16:01.728 --> 1:16:04.768
Make sure it's your time
you're wasting, not ours.

1:16:17.660 --> 1:16:18.950
How much must I pay

1:16:21.748 --> 1:16:22.958
to be with you?

1:16:23.875 --> 1:16:25.455
Depends what you want.

1:16:39.683 --> 1:16:40.393
What's that stuff?

1:16:44.688 --> 1:16:46.148
I'm creating a perfume.

1:16:49.693 --> 1:16:51.073
Lie down, please.

1:17:11.089 --> 1:17:12.219
It feels horrible.

1:17:13.842 --> 1:17:17.222
It's only animal fat.
To soak up your scent.

1:17:18.179 --> 1:17:19.969
Creating a perfume, eh?

1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:23.940
Admit it. You're getting
some sort of bang out of this.

1:17:24.936 --> 1:17:25.846
Aren't you?

1:17:27.105 --> 1:17:28.305
I enjoy my work.

1:17:30.442 --> 1:17:31.782
Hold your arm still.

1:17:40.326 --> 1:17:41.786
Don't think
you're gonna tie me up.

1:17:43.329 --> 1:17:44.909
Hold out your arm, please.

1:17:53.048 --> 1:17:54.758
I've come across some
strange men in my time...

1:17:55.008 --> 1:17:57.758
Just relax.

1:18:05.769 --> 1:18:07.729
Holy Mother, what's that?!

1:18:11.232 --> 1:18:12.862
Just for scraping off the fat.

1:18:13.193 --> 1:18:16.283
- Are you mad?
- Relax. You'll ruin everything.

1:18:17.697 --> 1:18:21.327
If you're frightened, you stink.
Then your perfume will be spoiled.

1:18:21.576 --> 1:18:23.116
I've had enough.

1:18:24.204 --> 1:18:26.714
Here, take your money.

1:18:27.749 --> 1:18:31.129
Basting me up in all this goo.
You think I am a Christmas goose?

1:18:31.419 --> 1:18:32.629
Get out of here!

1:21:59.419 --> 1:22:02.759
Quickly, blow them out
before the roses melt!

1:22:02.964 --> 1:22:05.264
- Roses can't melt, Papa!
- These ones can.

1:22:20.482 --> 1:22:24.652
Now I'd like to propose a toast
to our guest of honour,

1:22:24.903 --> 1:22:27.243
his Excellency,
the Marquis de Montesquieu.

1:22:27.947 --> 1:22:30.617
May our trade
continue to flourish!

1:22:36.039 --> 1:22:37.039
I thank you all

1:22:37.665 --> 1:22:40.415
and would ask of you
the honour to be the first

1:22:40.585 --> 1:22:42.995
to offer my congratulations
to your beautiful daughter

1:22:43.338 --> 1:22:46.168
and present her with a small
token of my affection.

1:22:53.682 --> 1:22:54.522
It's beautiful.

1:23:12.450 --> 1:23:14.040
I'm overwhelmed, your Grace.

1:23:14.536 --> 1:23:15.406
"Your Grace"?

1:23:16.746 --> 1:23:20.036
I had hoped that we would be
on more familiar terms by now.

1:23:23.420 --> 1:23:25.130
Let's have a game
of hide-and-seek!

1:23:25.296 --> 1:23:27.876
Oh yes! But everyone must play!

1:23:30.135 --> 1:23:32.215
Let the men catch the women.

1:23:39.394 --> 1:23:40.904
Albine! Wait!

1:25:10.485 --> 1:25:12.775
Put me down. Please?

1:25:17.867 --> 1:25:19.487
Now there's no escape.

1:25:50.150 --> 1:25:51.990
Game's over, everybody.

1:25:54.362 --> 1:25:55.162
Laura?

1:25:57.240 --> 1:25:58.580
Time to go in now.

1:26:23.308 --> 1:26:24.138
Laura?

1:26:42.869 --> 1:26:45.369
Albine? Françoise?

1:26:51.127 --> 1:26:53.047
Laura, have you seen the twins?

1:26:53.963 --> 1:26:55.673
No, not since the game started.

1:26:58.551 --> 1:27:00.681
Albine? Françoise?

1:27:11.731 --> 1:27:13.861
Albine? Françoise?

1:27:14.025 --> 1:27:14.645
Jacques?

1:27:16.444 --> 1:27:17.494
Take this way.

1:27:18.279 --> 1:27:19.699
You two with me.

1:27:19.864 --> 1:27:23.454
Your Excellency? Through here.

1:27:28.665 --> 1:27:30.495
Albine! Françoise!

1:28:41.988 --> 1:28:45.118
I told that cretin ten times
to get these ready!

1:28:45.450 --> 1:28:47.160
Don't keep picking on the boy.

1:28:48.453 --> 1:28:50.463
I'll kill him, the useless
little sewer rat!

1:28:51.456 --> 1:28:52.246
Grenouille!

1:28:53.917 --> 1:28:55.247
What are you doing?

1:28:55.418 --> 1:28:57.498
Why aren't the enfleurage
frames...

1:29:04.552 --> 1:29:05.262
Yes, master?

1:29:05.929 --> 1:29:10.019
I mean, would you be good enough
to prepare the enfleurage frames?

1:29:14.104 --> 1:29:15.654
Certainly, master.

1:29:31.579 --> 1:29:32.959
Acurfew?

1:29:33.415 --> 1:29:34.825
Are you mad?

1:29:34.999 --> 1:29:38.039
Jasmine can only be picked
before dawn. We all know that.

1:29:38.211 --> 1:29:41.011
This could mean
the ruin of our trade.

1:29:41.297 --> 1:29:41.967
Yours.

1:29:43.008 --> 1:29:44.588
And yours and yours.

1:29:46.094 --> 1:29:48.224
Supposing it's your daughter
next time.

1:29:50.265 --> 1:29:53.935
Of course a curfew is necessary,
but we also have to catch this man

1:29:54.102 --> 1:29:58.272
and to do that is to understand
how he thinks, what he wants.

1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:02.070
I should have thought that
was obvious. Use your imagination.

1:30:02.277 --> 1:30:04.947
And if I were to tell you
that all except the prostitute

1:30:05.113 --> 1:30:07.493
went to their graves
with their chastity intact?

1:30:08.450 --> 1:30:09.580
How would you know?

1:30:09.826 --> 1:30:13.616
The coroner had each girl examined.
They were all found to be virgins.

1:30:16.082 --> 1:30:18.132
Supposing there isn't a next time?

1:30:18.710 --> 1:30:22.380
If we introduce a curfew we
may all go bankrupt for nothing.

1:30:24.841 --> 1:30:26.801
So we wait until he's killed,
what? Six?

1:30:27.719 --> 1:30:29.219
Seven? Eight?

1:30:54.996 --> 1:30:57.496
Curfew!
Go back to your homes!

1:31:12.514 --> 1:31:13.644
Gentlemen!

1:31:14.057 --> 1:31:14.847
Gentlemen!

1:31:15.975 --> 1:31:19.935
We have to face the fact that our
police are helpless in this matter.

1:31:20.271 --> 1:31:22.941
I suggest that we ask
for support from Paris.

1:31:23.233 --> 1:31:25.033
Paris won't be smarter than we are.

1:31:25.527 --> 1:31:26.947
We must arrest every Gypsy
in Provence. And every beggar.

1:31:27.404 --> 1:31:29.164
And every man without
a wife and family!

1:31:29.406 --> 1:31:30.236
Listen.

1:31:32.951 --> 1:31:37.041
We have to put ourselves
inside the mind of this man.

1:31:37.622 --> 1:31:41.752
Each of his victims
had an especial beauty.

1:31:42.002 --> 1:31:46.092
We know he doesn't want
their virginity, so it seems to me

1:31:46.256 --> 1:31:48.966
that it's their beauty itself
that he wants.

1:31:49.217 --> 1:31:51.887
It's almost as if he's trying
to gather something.

1:31:52.262 --> 1:31:55.682
As if his ambitions
are those of a collector.

1:31:56.599 --> 1:31:58.479
A collector? Of what?

1:31:59.728 --> 1:32:00.518
Their hair?

1:32:07.736 --> 1:32:11.906
Whatever it is,
I fear he won't stop killing

1:32:12.198 --> 1:32:15.078
until his collection is complete.

1:32:40.643 --> 1:32:41.353
Monsieur.

1:32:44.564 --> 1:32:48.534
This man is a demon.

1:32:48.777 --> 1:32:51.817
A phantom who cannot be fought
by human means.

1:32:51.988 --> 1:32:56.028
Now, I insist that we call upon
our bishop to excommunicate him!

1:32:57.410 --> 1:32:59.080
What good would that do?

1:32:59.496 --> 1:33:02.746
Have you no faith in the power
of our Holy Mother Church?

1:33:04.542 --> 1:33:06.092
This is not a matter of faith.

1:33:06.378 --> 1:33:07.838
There's a murderer out there

1:33:08.046 --> 1:33:11.506
and we must catch him
by using our God-given wits!

1:33:12.300 --> 1:33:15.180
I say until
we submit to Mother Church

1:33:16.054 --> 1:33:18.014
these killings will not cease.

1:33:34.948 --> 1:33:39.118
Citizens of Grasse, we hereby
declare that this murderer,

1:33:40.161 --> 1:33:42.411
this demon in our midst,

1:33:42.997 --> 1:33:47.087
has incurred the sentence
of excommunication.

1:33:48.962 --> 1:33:51.972
Not only has this depraved monster

1:33:52.382 --> 1:33:54.882
robbed us of our daughters,

1:33:55.260 --> 1:33:57.970
the young and fair blossom
of this city,

1:33:58.304 --> 1:34:00.144
and by his wanton acts

1:34:00.724 --> 1:34:04.194
has brought our trade,
our livelihood,

1:34:04.352 --> 1:34:07.062
our very existence,

1:34:07.439 --> 1:34:10.359
to the brink of eternal darkness.

1:34:12.569 --> 1:34:13.819
We therefore declare

1:34:14.654 --> 1:34:16.664
that this vile viper,

1:34:16.823 --> 1:34:20.243
this ignominious carbuncle,

1:34:20.410 --> 1:34:23.540
this execrable evil in our midst,

1:34:23.705 --> 1:34:27.875
shall henceforth be solemnly
banned from our holy presence,

1:34:29.294 --> 1:34:33.424
rejected from the communion
of Holy Mother Church

1:34:34.049 --> 1:34:36.379
as a disciple of Satan,

1:34:37.719 --> 1:34:39.929
slayer of souls.

1:34:40.096 --> 1:34:40.806
Stand clear!

1:34:41.473 --> 1:34:45.103
An infected limb,
an outsider of the faith

1:34:46.478 --> 1:34:50.018
a necromancer,
a diabolist, a sorcerer

1:34:50.648 --> 1:34:52.938
and a damned heretic.

1:34:54.611 --> 1:34:57.911
Oh, God, in Thy most
merciful spirit,

1:34:59.157 --> 1:35:02.077
bring down thunderbolts
upon his head

1:35:02.911 --> 1:35:06.621
and may the Devil
make soup of his bones.

1:35:06.956 --> 1:35:08.116
Amen.

1:35:09.292 --> 1:35:11.502
My Lord! It's a miracle!

1:35:12.629 --> 1:35:14.509
He's been caught!
He's been caught!

1:35:16.549 --> 1:35:19.389
My Lord, the fiend has been caught.

1:35:20.178 --> 1:35:21.888
In the city of Grenoble.

1:35:22.055 --> 1:35:23.555
He's confessed to everything.

1:35:24.182 --> 1:35:26.182
He's confessed to everything!

1:35:28.395 --> 1:35:29.515
Hallelujah!

1:35:29.688 --> 1:35:32.018
Hallelujah!

1:35:32.982 --> 1:35:34.442
Praise be to God!

1:35:34.943 --> 1:35:36.613
And we thank Him

1:35:36.778 --> 1:35:40.278
for listening to our prayers
and answering them.

1:35:41.157 --> 1:35:43.987
Amen.

1:35:44.619 --> 1:35:46.789
Amen.

1:36:02.929 --> 1:36:04.639
Just read the report.

1:36:04.806 --> 1:36:06.766
This cannot possibly
be the same man.

1:36:10.020 --> 1:36:14.190
He confessed to everything.
Including the murders in Grasse.

1:36:14.357 --> 1:36:16.647
Yes. Under torture.

1:36:18.236 --> 1:36:19.066
Look. Here.

1:36:20.363 --> 1:36:23.033
He admits to strangling
his victims,

1:36:23.199 --> 1:36:25.909
pulling out their hair
and ravaging them.

1:36:26.077 --> 1:36:29.207
The Grasse girls were killed by
a blow to the back of their heads

1:36:29.372 --> 1:36:32.542
their hair was carefully cropped,
and not one of them was violated.

1:36:32.709 --> 1:36:33.339
Antoine,

1:36:35.086 --> 1:36:37.506
we're all happy it's over.

1:36:38.465 --> 1:36:39.255
Let it go.

1:37:27.263 --> 1:37:30.143
- Papa, what's the matter?
- We're going home. Now!

1:37:30.308 --> 1:37:31.728
But why? I'm enjoying myself.

1:37:31.893 --> 1:37:35.023
- Don't argue with me, Laura.
- Stop it! I'm going...

1:37:42.779 --> 1:37:43.409
Laura!

1:37:45.156 --> 1:37:45.986
Laura!

1:37:49.536 --> 1:37:50.866
Out of my way!

1:37:51.579 --> 1:37:52.209
Laura!

1:38:49.387 --> 1:38:50.257
Laura!

1:38:51.556 --> 1:38:52.306
Papa!

1:38:58.730 --> 1:38:59.940
I'm so sorry.

1:39:13.870 --> 1:39:16.660
I know you must think me
a very foolish man,

1:39:17.999 --> 1:39:19.959
but try to understand

1:39:21.044 --> 1:39:22.554
you're all I have left.

1:39:22.712 --> 1:39:24.592
You don't need to explain, Papa.

1:39:24.756 --> 1:39:27.546
- If anything were to happen to you...
- I know.

1:39:28.343 --> 1:39:31.393
But you must stop worrying
about me all the time.

1:39:52.158 --> 1:39:53.738
Sweet dreams, my love.

1:39:57.914 --> 1:39:59.504
Sweet dreams, Papa.

1:40:59.601 --> 1:41:00.691
Laura!

1:41:11.488 --> 1:41:13.778
Papa, what's the matter?

1:41:18.661 --> 1:41:19.871
Did you open the window?

1:41:22.207 --> 1:41:22.827
No.

1:41:23.541 --> 1:41:24.381
Why?

1:41:27.754 --> 1:41:31.844
Have this letter dispatched to the
Marquis de Montesquieu immediately.

1:42:20.932 --> 1:42:23.352
Stay on the road north
into the mountains.

1:42:41.453 --> 1:42:43.163
Did Monsieur Richis leave?

1:42:43.329 --> 1:42:43.959
He did.

1:42:44.372 --> 1:42:45.172
Which way?

1:42:46.624 --> 1:42:47.464
North.

1:42:54.466 --> 1:42:56.126
You sure it wasn't south?

1:42:56.301 --> 1:42:59.851
I saw them with my own eyes.
Why do you want to know?

1:43:01.598 --> 1:43:04.178
I said north. North!

1:43:06.603 --> 1:43:07.483
Grenouille!

1:43:10.065 --> 1:43:10.935
Grenouille!

1:43:14.027 --> 1:43:14.897
Grenouille!

1:43:25.663 --> 1:43:26.583
Grenouille!

1:43:43.556 --> 1:43:44.306
Good God!

1:44:41.239 --> 1:44:42.659
Good afternoon, Monsieur.

1:44:43.366 --> 1:44:46.036
Good afternoon. Do you have
anyone else staying here?

1:44:46.661 --> 1:44:47.411
No, Monsieur.

1:44:47.996 --> 1:44:50.416
Then I would like to take
all your rooms for the night.

1:44:50.582 --> 1:44:52.752
It will be our pleasure, Monsieur.

1:44:54.210 --> 1:44:57.800
And tomorrow, at first light, we wish
to be ferried to the lle de Lérin.

1:44:58.548 --> 1:45:02.008
- It's deserted, just a few monks.
- I'm aware of that.

1:45:02.969 --> 1:45:03.679
Very well, Monsieur.

1:45:08.808 --> 1:45:10.438
Our finest room, Mademoiselle.

1:45:13.646 --> 1:45:15.316
With a superb view of the sea.

1:45:16.316 --> 1:45:17.106
One moment.

1:45:23.865 --> 1:45:24.485
Very well.

1:45:25.992 --> 1:45:28.622
Do you have a room next to this one?

1:45:28.787 --> 1:45:32.867
- Yes, but the view is different.
- I have no interest in the view.

1:46:26.469 --> 1:46:30.019
Papa, will you please tell me
now what is happening?

1:46:30.974 --> 1:46:33.144
You haven't said a word all day.

1:46:33.727 --> 1:46:35.557
Why all this secrecy?

1:46:39.733 --> 1:46:41.573
Last night I dreamt you were dead,

1:46:43.111 --> 1:46:45.321
murdered like all the other girls.

1:46:54.914 --> 1:46:58.134
The truth is, I'm convinced that
the killer is still here somewhere.

1:46:59.961 --> 1:47:02.261
All of his victims
were young and beautiful,

1:47:02.422 --> 1:47:04.302
and who is there more beautiful
than you, Laura?

1:47:06.426 --> 1:47:08.136
Whatever his insane scheme,

1:47:08.386 --> 1:47:11.216
it will surely be incomplete
without you.

1:47:20.106 --> 1:47:23.226
I wrote to the Marquis accepting
his proposal of marriage

1:47:23.443 --> 1:47:26.323
and requesting that it take place
as soon as possible.

1:47:27.864 --> 1:47:30.994
Until then you will stay
in the safety of the monastery.

1:47:32.702 --> 1:47:35.712
And all this because
you had a bad dream?

1:47:36.081 --> 1:47:39.291
- I've made my decision.
- But I don't know if I love him!

1:47:39.709 --> 1:47:41.959
I'm afraid the circumstances
leave us no choice.

1:47:42.128 --> 1:47:44.208
- Papa!
- It's all arranged, Laura.

1:53:34.564 --> 1:53:36.984
On your feet.
Hands in the air!

1:54:23.238 --> 1:54:25.738
Why did you kill my daughter?

1:54:29.869 --> 1:54:30.619
Why?

1:54:34.499 --> 1:54:35.499
I needed her.

1:55:02.277 --> 1:55:04.697
Why did you kill my daughter?

1:55:08.992 --> 1:55:09.952
I just...

1:55:13.413 --> 1:55:14.543
needed her.

1:55:22.797 --> 1:55:23.837
Very well.

1:55:26.092 --> 1:55:28.432
But remember this.

1:55:34.934 --> 1:55:36.484
I will be looking at you

1:55:39.522 --> 1:55:41.272
when you are laid on the cross

1:55:41.441 --> 1:55:45.401
and the twelve blows
are crashing down on your limbs.

1:55:48.156 --> 1:55:51.786
And when the crowd has finally tired

1:55:51.951 --> 1:55:54.701
of your screams and wandered home,

1:55:54.954 --> 1:55:58.544
I will climb up through your blood

1:56:01.169 --> 1:56:02.959
and sit beside you.

1:56:05.090 --> 1:56:08.010
I will look deep into your eyes

1:56:10.136 --> 1:56:12.306
and drop by drop

1:56:14.933 --> 1:56:18.693
I will trickle my disgust into them

1:56:20.689 --> 1:56:23.529
like burning acid,

1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:26.650
until

1:56:30.323 --> 1:56:31.623
finally

1:56:35.662 --> 1:56:36.962
you perish.

1:58:37.659 --> 1:58:39.619
Unchain the prisoner.

1:58:50.755 --> 1:58:52.165
That's enough.

1:58:53.758 --> 1:58:55.638
Let him be brought to the scaffold.

1:59:00.849 --> 1:59:01.769
What's that?

2:00:16.007 --> 2:00:17.377
He's over there.

2:02:07.952 --> 2:02:10.582
This man is innocent!

2:02:16.002 --> 2:02:17.502
He is innocent!

2:03:41.671 --> 2:03:42.301
An angel!

2:03:43.631 --> 2:03:44.631
This is no man!

2:03:45.508 --> 2:03:47.088
This is an angel!

2:09:48.997 --> 2:09:49.997
Grenouille!

2:09:56.296 --> 2:09:58.376
You can't fool me!

2:10:47.430 --> 2:10:48.350
Forgive me,

2:10:55.647 --> 2:10:56.727
my son.

2:12:00.086 --> 2:12:04.086
The people of Grasse
awoke to a terrible hangover.

2:12:05.592 --> 2:12:09.012
For many of them,
the experience was so ghastly,

2:12:09.179 --> 2:12:12.809
so completely inexplicable and
incompatible with their morals

2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:16.600
that they literally erased it
from their memories.

2:12:17.729 --> 2:12:20.649
The town council was
in session by the afternoon

2:12:20.815 --> 2:12:23.105
and an order was passed
to the police lieutenant

2:12:23.276 --> 2:12:26.906
to immediately begin fresh
investigations into the murders.

2:12:28.406 --> 2:12:31.276
The following day,
Dominique Druot was arrested.

2:12:31.451 --> 2:12:35.621
It was in his back yard that they
found the hair of the victims.

2:12:36.956 --> 2:12:40.536
After fourteen hours of torture,
Druot confessed to everything.

2:12:43.463 --> 2:12:45.883
With that, the case was closed.

2:12:50.136 --> 2:12:54.096
By then, Grenouille was already
half way back to Paris.

2:12:58.186 --> 2:13:02.356
He had enough perfume left to
enslave the world if he so chose.

2:13:03.233 --> 2:13:06.443
He could walk to Versailles
and have the King kiss his feet.

2:13:06.903 --> 2:13:11.073
He could write the Pope a letter,
reveal himself as the new Messiah.

2:13:12.200 --> 2:13:14.700
He could do all this
and more if he wanted to.

2:13:15.870 --> 2:13:18.750
He possessed a power stronger
than the power of money,

2:13:18.915 --> 2:13:20.705
or terror, or death.

2:13:21.376 --> 2:13:25.376
The invincible power to command
the love of mankind.

2:13:32.012 --> 2:13:35.102
There was only one thing
the perfume could not do:

2:13:35.348 --> 2:13:38.098
It could not turn him
into a person

2:13:38.268 --> 2:13:40.478
who could love and be loved
like everyone else.

2:13:41.855 --> 2:13:44.315
So, to hell with it, he thought.

2:13:44.482 --> 2:13:46.072
To hell with the world,

2:13:46.359 --> 2:13:47.689
with the perfume,

2:13:48.069 --> 2:13:49.399
with himself.

2:13:52.198 --> 2:13:55.368
On the 25th of June, 1766,

2:13:55.744 --> 2:13:57.414
around 11 o'clock at night,

2:13:58.038 --> 2:14:01.328
Grenouille entered the city
through the Port d'Orleans

2:14:01.499 --> 2:14:03.339
and like a sleep-walker,

2:14:03.835 --> 2:14:08.005
his olfactory memories drew him
back to where he was born.

2:15:30.797 --> 2:15:32.337
An angel!

2:15:35.135 --> 2:15:36.505
I love you!

2:16:24.184 --> 2:16:27.234
Within no time,
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille

2:16:27.395 --> 2:16:29.765
had disappeared from
the face of the earth.

2:16:30.940 --> 2:16:35.110
When they had finished, they
felt a virginal glow of happiness.

2:16:36.571 --> 2:16:38.701
Forthe first time
in their lives

2:16:39.366 --> 2:16:41.446
they believed that they
had done something

2:16:42.202 --> 2:16:45.042
purely out of love.

2:17:17.112 --> 2:17:19.452
- Ey, over here!
- Look!

2:17:27.163 --> 2:17:28.423
Look, a jacket!

2:17:29.082 --> 2:17:30.632
Let's take them all home.
